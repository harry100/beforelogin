## Beforelogin
This is a browser (Chrome for now) extension, that helps us spot possible phishing attacks.

## How it works?
When users visit a phishing site, usually thats the first time they visit it.
This extension warns users when they directly land on a web page that asks for their password.

It also allows one to whitelist websites. When users visit one of these sites they are
displayed a green tick to let them know that it is one of the trusted websites.

These 2 features will help users to spot possible phishing attacks.
